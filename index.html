		<h1>NOBO Gallery</h1>
		<p>NOBO Gallery is a fictional art gallery website based on the ideals of inspiring and connecting individuals, particularly youth, through art and creativity. With a focus on a bold, bright, and eye-catching design, the NOBO Gallery website engages the viewer immediately in a world of creativity that emulates the inspiring gallery experience they offer. This is a current school project that took place over the span of around two months. The creation of NOBO Gallery to the point it is at now, as refined mockups, was entirely a solo project done by Nolan Boyd. </p>

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<P>The process started with research on various gallery websites, ultimately selecting the Vancouver Art Gallery as a reference for website structure. Delving into their values and character, I crafted a mood board and checked colour contrast for the VAG. Next, I embarked on creating a new mood board, multiple colour contrast charts, and type scales, aligning them with the desired values and character for my own gallery website.</P>

		</div>
		<p>After the initial mood-board, preliminary colour and type choices have been made, I went on to creating rough wireframes. This was a quick process, really just focusing on finding the general layout for the Home, Visit, and Learn pages of both mobile and desktop.</p>
		<div class="mediaRow">
			<img class="image" src="img/wireframeOne638x487.jpg" alt="rough, hand drawn wireframes for NOBO gallery" width="638" height="487">
			<img class="image" src="img/wireframeTwo746x487.jpg" alt="rough, hand drawn wireframes for NOBO gallery" width="638" height="487">
		</div>
		<p>Once the general layout was configured, I went into grey-box wireframes. This process allowed me to flesh out more of a final structure for all the necessary modules and components of both mobile and desktop, as well as figuring out some of the main text that would be included in the site.</p>

				<source src="vid/learnPageMobileGrey460x747.mov" type="video/mp4">
			  </video>
	</div>
		<p>After the grey-box wireframes were to my liking, I went in with colour, added images, and filled out any remaining filler text with real content. Below is the result of the first iteration of the full fidelity mockups for desktop.</p>
		<div class="mediaRow">

				<source src="vid/learnPageDesktopIteration460x299.mov" type="video/mp4">
			  </video>
		</div>
		<p>After reviewing my first iteration of full-fidelity mock ups, I made some final tweaks to type-scales, colour, padding and margins, refined the look of some important modules, and created all states for interactive portions of the site.</p>
		<div class="mediaRow">
			<img class="image" src="img/typescale460x630.jpg" alt="final typescale for NOBO gallery website" width="460" height="630">

		</div>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>The process of creating NOBO gallery challenged my skills as a designer in many ways. I refined the process of taking a design from the research and conceptual phase, through to the final full-fidelity on my own. This process ingrained the importance of iterating, feedback, and acknowledging failures as learning lessons, and using them to help formulate a better path for your design.</p>
